# Foreign-born population in Canada

A responsive bar chart implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) that shows
the percentage of foreign-born population in Canada between 1871 and 2011. 

Hovering over a bar causes the corresponding percentage of foreign-born population and year to be shown. 

This project was bootstrapped with the [Svelte app template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
